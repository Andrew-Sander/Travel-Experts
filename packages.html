			He wants it easy, he want it relaxed
			Said, "I can do a lot of things, but I can't do that"
			Two steps forward, then three steps back, alright
			Won't you take a walk outside? Oh, no
			Can't you find some other guy? Oh, no
			One-nine-six-nine, what's that sound? Oh, no
			Keeping down the underground, oh, no

			I backed my car into a cop car the other day
			Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay
			I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say?
			Well, you just laughed it off, it was all okay

			And we'll all float on, okay
			And we'll all float on, okay
			And we'll all float on, okay
			And we'll all float on anyway, well

			A fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
			It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand
			Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands
			Good news will work its way to all them plans
			We both got fired on exactly the same day
			Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way

			Bring it on, here we are, win or lose, win or lose
			Win or lose, win or lose, win or lose, win or lose
			Win or lose, win or lose, I can't say

			And we'll all float on, okay
			And we'll all float on, okay
			And we'll all float on, okay
			And we'll all float on, alright

			Already, we'll all float on
			No, don't you worry, we'll all float on, alright
			Already, we'll all float on, alright
			Don't worry, we'll all float on

			(Alright, already) And we'll all float on
			Alright, already, we'll all float on, alright
			Don't worry, even if things end up a bit too heavy
			We'll all float on
			Alright, already, we'll all float on (I'm told don't function and listen everyday)
			Alright, already, we'll all float on (The worlds' still going strong)
			Okay, don't worry, we'll all float on (I lose hair)
			Even if things get heavy, we'll all float on (while living here)
			Alright, already, we'll all float on (Alright!) (float on)
			Now don't you worry, we'll all float on (Alright!)
